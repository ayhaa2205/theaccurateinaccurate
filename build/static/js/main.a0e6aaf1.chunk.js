Thus every project starts by identifying opportunities that are latent in a broad range of circumstances. \\n \\n Trying to identify an opportunity for building in the Swiss mountains, one material can hardly be ignored since it is for free and available in abundance: Snow.

Through their efficient structural behaviour concrete shell structures are able to cover large spaces at minimal material consumption. They are thin, curved plate structures shaped to transmit applied forces by compressive, tensile, and shear stresses, that act in the plane of the surface1. \\n \\n In the design of shell constructions nature was first introduced by Heinz Isler. With the aid of models he observed natural phenomena that he used for finding forms that follow the natural flow of forces. With this very thin shells could be realised. Natural processes were used as a design tool for the design process. To this category also the soap film experiments of Otto Frei can be attributed. One of the main principles is the inversion of tension only forms to forms under compression. \\n \\n In contrast to their structural efficiency the construction of shells traditionally requires both material- and labor-intensive formworks. Often materials are only used once, since they are customised for a specific geometry. Moreover in a contemporary building environment labor is expensive and therefore makes concrete shell structures rather costly. \\n \\n 1 from Encyclopaedia Britannica"}],[{"contentType":"carousel","content":[{"slideType":"image","content":"C-01_IMG_3372.JPG","slideDescription":"Following the natural flow of forces shells can be very thin.

In our process however surface temperatures of the concrete will be around 0\xb0C where it comes in contact with the snow.  Therefore we collaborate with the the Institute of Physical Chemistry of Building Materials to find an adequate mixture and to test material behaviour in cold environments. \\n \\n Two different mixtures are compared: One stabilized, self-compacting mixture and another one with potash added for improved behaviour in cold environments. Four samples are stored in a cooling chamber at -1\xb0C, two samples are cured in a climate chamber at ideal conditions and two other samples are directly cast on ice surfaces. The ingredients are cooled down to a temperature of 4\xb0C before mixing. \\n \\n After seven days the compressive strength of the different samples is compared: The cold-environment-samples of the stabilized-self-compacting concrete withstand approximately 10% less compressive strength than the ones being cured under ideal conditions, whereas potash-samples exhibit signifacantly inferior behaviour.

First shells were planned with the help of basic mathematically defined forms: Cupolas, barrel vaults; These shapes can easily be described mathematically and therefore their complexity becomes manageable. Shell pioneers like Felix Candela introduced more complex mathematically defined forms like hyperbolic paraboloids. In this evolution Eduardo Torroja used simple principles for generating even more complex forms. Often these mathematically defined shapes appear very elegant. Since they follow a formation process our mind can understand their creation to a certain degree. \\n \\n To test the viability of the previous experiments a structural prototype is erected. The shape is created with a simple mathematical operation: A sinus curve is extruded along a parabola to create an arch. Under self-weight a catenary is the most efficient for for spanning a distance. However, since the goal is to stand on the structure, also asymmetrical loading cases have to be taken into account. The corrugation of the sinus curve adds structural depth to make the arch more stable for asymmetrical loading cases. This makes the arch more robust for inaccuracies of the formwork material as well. In this manner the slight difference between parabola and catenary can be neglected. \\n \\n With this method an arch spanning 1.8m with a height of 1m is constructed. The developed concrete mixture is used without any reinforcement. The finished arch is able to withstand the point load of two people of approximately 150 kg."}],[{"contentType":"carousel","content":[{"slideType":"image","content":"F-01_IMG_3228.jpg","slideDescription":"An accurate framework is erected to precisely measure in a form."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-02_Bild-000006.jpg","slideDescription":"Because of a shortage of material supply snow is harvested from further away."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-03_Bild-000025.jpg","slideDescription":"And accumulated on site."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-04_Bild-000032.jpg","slideDescription":"Snow needs to be piled into a form."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-05_Bild-000014.jpg","slideDescription":"For a strong formwork the material is compacted in the process."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-06_IMG_4142.jpg","slideDescription":"A rough shape is ready."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-07_Bild-000044.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in accurate measurements."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-08_IMG_4162.jpg","slideDescription":"Additional material is supplied by nature."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-09_P1777521.jpg","slideDescription":"A simple shaping device is used for adding corrugation to the form."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-10_IMG_4928.jpg","slideDescription":"Robust foundations are in form to take horizontal forces."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-11_IMG_8882.jpg","slideDescription":"The snow surface has been shaped with care."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-13_Bild-000075.jpg","slideDescription":"Plan for the unexpected: Concrete mixing in a snow storm"},{"slideType":"video","content":"F-14_2020-05-13_CurtainArch-Concreting.mov","slideDescription":"If the mixture is adjusted properly concreting can be done at very steep surfaces."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-15_IMG_4172.jpg","slideDescription":"The sun comes out and everything looks promising."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-16_IMG_2584.jpg","slideDescription":"Not everything goes according to plan."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-17_P1788217.jpg","slideDescription":"Finally the work is done and the concrete is hardening."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-18_P1788190.jpg","slideDescription":"Corrugation adds structural redundancies allowing for mistakes."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-19_IMG_4205.jpg","slideDescription":"Protecting the concrete from sun and snow."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-20_IMG_0642.jpg","slideDescription":"Additional layer of insulation provided by nature"},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-23_IMG_4354.jpg","slideDescription":"The demolding process is done by the sun with slow care."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-24_P1822010.jpg","slideDescription":"Finally standing on its own."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-25_P1822017.jpg","slideDescription":"Corrugation increases structural depth to accommodate various loading cases."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-26_P1822030.jpg","slideDescription":"The thickness of the concrete is between one and two centimetres."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-27_IMG_4485.jpg","slideDescription":"In direct contact with the snow not all cement fully reacts because of melting water."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-28_P1822253.jpg","slideDescription":"Every structure needs to be properly tested."},{"slideType":"image","content":"F-29_P1822115.JPG","slideDescription":"A succesful experiment demonstrating the possibilities of snow as formwork."}]},{"contentType":"carousel","content":[{"slideType":"image","content":"F-30_Plans13.jpg","slideDescription":"The form is found mathematically: A sinus-curve is extruded along a parabola.

It provides chances for randomness and accidents. In an analogy the human is not just a rational being, but has also irrational needs that need to be catered for. For this realm architecture has to provide spaces and stimuli as well. In traditional Japanese architecture crooked trees are used for construction to incorporate the poetic. Eero Saarinen writes in his reflections about the expressive form that structural and rational can\u2019t always be given precedence if other forms prove more beautiful. \\n \\n For this reason in a next experiment a different approach is tested: A snow pile is shaped intuitively as in a form of abstract painting. Nevertheless in building the intent of the human is always of importance, which is why the uncontrolled should be controlled. Only contemporary technology makes it possible to handle this uncontrolledness. With the help of a 3D-Laserscanner at any time the form can be recorded within minutes in millimetre precision. Therefore this form is then recorded with a pointcloud. With this the shape is transferred into the digital where further alterations are possible.

In first experiments exact forms were thought digitally and then produced manually. Our relationship can be indeed expended by thinking manually and then producing digitally. This can result in a final result or can be translated back again from virtuality to physical reality. In our physical reality scale plays an enormous role, in the digital usually scale doesn\u2019t matter. Therefore our project is also a starting point to rethink our relationship with the digital and mechanical. Chance and mathematical exactitude don\u2019t exclude each other. In an analogous way our design process corresponds to stochastic calculatory processes of contemporary computational networks or searching algorithms such as google. Markov-chains make it possible to find probable solutions for the future without knowing all elements precisely. \\n \\n In a next step a snow form can be built in 1 to 1 scale. After recording with a laser scanner this form can be analysed structurally and adapted until satisfaction. In an iterative process adapting, scanning, analysing take turns to find a form. The adaption is done by hand in the awareness that a quality of architecture can lie in the handcrafted, manually executed. Once a form is found concreting can happen to turn the shape from a negative into a positive. \\n \\n In this way processes come together that haven\u2019t been combined before. The form is not only natural but also technical. Through this it withdraws itself partially from understanding and introduces a new quality of the mysterious combined with technology."}],[{"contentType":"carousel","content":[{"slideType":"image","content":"H-01__IMG_6801.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony

In times of digitalising the architectural design process for the meticulous planning up to whole building models, this process restores freedom to the architect in the building process. On that point Seijima argues how important it is for her to handle the presence of undefined variables in the design process4. In our process there is also a rough idea of what should be created. The definitive outcome though is strongly influenced by the process: A maximum gradient is given by how the material can be accumulated. New Forms are created through melting. Sometimes the architect decides on site to alter the form. Openings are a result to reach all surface area while concreting. It is more like playing a game. Sometimes chance and intuition are taking their turn, other times deliberate decisions are made. \\n \\n Step by step our experiments were oscillating between these two worlds. A first small-scale experiment was structurally optimised for compression forces in RhinoVault. Through measuring this form was more or less accurately recreated on site. For a next structural experiment inaccuracies were taken into account through incorporating structural redundancies. Folding increases the structural section and make a structure more robust for inaccuracies. For redundancies folds were also used for a further experiment where they were created from spontaneous opportunities. Structurally these deformations were controlled to keep folding only in favourable directions. We understand our investigations as a starting point to think about the potential of materials, the digital in architecture and the relationship of construction and mysterious. Architecture is a rational as well as an irrational endeavour and will always only be negotiated between these two fields. 4 in ElCroquis 77(I), kazuo sejima; koji taki (1996), conversation with kazuo sejima, p. 6-17;"}],[{"contentType":"carousel","content":[{"slideType":"image","content":"I-00_DJI_0092.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-00_DJI_0093.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-01_P1844367.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-02_IMG_6896.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-02b_DJI_0123.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-03_IMG_2069.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-04_P1844715.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-05_IMG_1417.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-06_IMG_7257.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-07_IMG_6663.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-08_IMG_7278.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-09_IMG_6726.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-10_IMG_7292.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-11_IMG_6694.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-12_IMG_6719.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-13_IMG_6717.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-14_P1877033.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-15_IMG_6733.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-16_P1855037.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-17_a2547d01-5a22-4146-8ce4-f047498c7779.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-18_P1877087.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-19_IMG_7362.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-20_P1877117.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-21_P1877162.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-22_P1877200.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-23_P1877224.jpg","slideDescription":"Melting Snow"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-24_JLIT7480.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-25_IMG_7278.jpg","slideDescription":"Anthony carrying"}]},{"contentType":"carousel","content":[{"slideType":"image","content":"I-27_DronePointcloudwithShell.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-27b_Ghosted.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-27a_IMG_A82AAB52CA09-1.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-26b_2020-03-15_Innenraum_02.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-26_2020-03-15_Innenraum_02.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"video","content":"I-28_2020-04-28_Glaspass-Schneehu\u0308gel.mov","slideDescription":"Quadmesh"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-29_01_Shaded.jpg","slideDescription":"Quadmesh"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-29_03_Shaded.jpg","slideDescription":"Quadmesh"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-30_VaultFreeformHandshape.jpg","slideDescription":"DroneScan"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-31_2020-03-21_Schneeberg01.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-32_2020-03-21_Schneeberg02.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-33_2020-03-21_Schneeberg03.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-34_2020-03-21_Schneeberg04.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-35_2020-03-24_Schneeberg09.jpg","slideDescription":"Force Diagram"},{"slideType":"video","content":"I-36_2020-03-24_Schneeberg16.jpg","slideDescription":"Quadmesh"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-37_2020-03-24_Schneeberg22.jpg","slideDescription":"DroneScan"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-38_2020-03-24_Schneeberg23.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"},{"slideType":"image","content":"I-39_2020-03-24_Schneeberg28.jpg","slideDescription":"Measuring in"}]}],[{"contentType":"text","content":"*#Natural Formations* \\n \\n Since day one humans have been occupied with nature as a source of inspiration, as a goal as well as a challenge in its perfection.
