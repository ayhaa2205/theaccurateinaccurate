Therefore every architectural project must start with being sensitive to what is at hand. A place, a material condition. Since in architecture we are going to expend an enormous amount of energy, we have to take the circumstances to our advantage. Thus every project starts by identifying opportunities that are latent in a broad range of circumstances. \n \n Trying to identify an opportunity for building in the Swiss mountains, one material can hardly be ignored since it is for free and available in abundance: Snow. Because it is subject to transformation processes, the idea is to use it as formwork material for concrete shells. In a first experiment the feasability of the concept is tested. In a backpack only cement is carried to the remote location. All other materials are sourced locally: Water from a lake, gravel from the surrounding site, snow from a leftover patch from last winter. \n \n Increasing computational methods introduced computational models to the design of shells, that simulate a potential optimal force flow and thus create a shape. These forms correspond with the optimal force flow and therefore generate efficient constructions under self load. Since concrete works best in compression, a precise form for compression is planned using RhinoVault."

We want to take advantage of these opportunities in our project. With every material it is about identifying the chances that are given by its inherent properties. By using snow as formwork material for concrete shells we give the uncontrolled influence in our experiments. \n \n A second experiment is conducted to explore potentials of snow shaping. The thermal properties of snow are harnessed to use hot water as a shaping tool. As a natural process not all factors can always be controlled, which leaves room for accident and emergence.

A project of architectural potential as well as environmental ambition. \n \n Snow is a porous material of air and water that forms mostly in the winter at temperatures around 0 °C. Architecturally, with its very specific properties around the freezing point, snow offers new possibilities for shaping and texturing, but also procedural advantages. As a method of temporary formwork construction it solves the problems of waste material and manual labour at the stage of demolding. \n \n In the process high technological planning comes together with hands-on construction using natural, locally available materials. Embracing constraint and contingency the process raises fundamental questions about where ideas of material supply and architectural culture should meet."

Through their efficient structural behaviour concrete shell structures are able to cover large spaces at minimal material consumption. They are thin, curved plate structures shaped to transmit applied forces by compressive, tensile, and shear stresses, that act in the plane of the surface1. \n \n In the design of shell constructions nature was first introduced by Heinz Isler. With the aid of models he observed natural phenomena that he used for finding forms that follow the natural flow of forces. With this very thin shells could be realised. Natural processes were used as a design tool for the design process. To this category also the soap film experiments of Otto Frei can be attributed. One of the main principles is the inversion of tension only forms to forms under compression. \n \n In contrast to their structural efficiency the construction of shells traditionally requires both material- and labor-intensive formworks. Often materials are only used once, since they are customised for a specific geometry. Moreover in a contemporary building environment labor is expensive and therefore makes concrete shell structures rather costly. \n \n 1 from Encyclopaedia Britannica"

In our process, however, surface temperatures of the concrete will be around 0°C where it comes in contact with the snow.  Therefore we collaborate with the the Institute of Physical Chemistry of Building Materials to find an adequate mixture and to test material behaviour in cold environments. \n \n Two different mixtures are compared: One stabilized, self-compacting mixture and another one with potash added for improved behaviour in cold environments. Four samples are stored in a cooling chamber at -1°C, two samples are cured in a climate chamber at ideal conditions and two other samples are directly cast on ice surfaces. The ingredients are cooled down to a temperature of 4°C before mixing. \n \n After seven days the compressive strength of the different samples is compared: The cold-environment-samples of the stabilized-self-compacting concrete withstand approximately 10% less compressive strength than the ones being cured under ideal conditions, whereas potash-samples exhibit signifacantly inferior behaviour. Therefore we decide on a mixture without potash that is easier to use as well. \n \n The idea is to use locally-sourced sand, gravel and water for the concrete mixture.

First shells were planned with the help of basic mathematically defined forms: Cupolas, barrel vaults; These shapes can easily be described mathematically and therefore their complexity becomes manageable. Shell pioneers like Felix Candela introduced more complex mathematically defined forms like hyperbolic paraboloids. In this evolution Eduardo Torroja used simple principles for generating even more complex forms. Often these mathematically defined shapes appear very elegant. Since they follow a formation process our mind can understand their creation to a certain degree. \n \n To test the viability of the previous experiments a structural prototype is erected. The shape is created with a simple mathematical operation: A sinus curve is extruded along a parabola to create an arch. Under self-weight a catenary is the most efficient for for spanning a distance. However, since the goal is to stand on the structure, also asymmetrical loading cases have to be taken into account. The corrugation of the sinus curve adds structural depth to make the arch more stable for asymmetrical loading cases. This makes the arch more robust for inaccuracies of the formwork material as well. In this manner the slight difference between parabola and catenary can be neglected. \n \n With this method an arch spanning 1.8m with a height of 1m is constructed. The developed concrete mixture is used without any reinforcement. The finished arch is able to withstand the point load of two people of approximately 150 kg."

There is a certain fascination for accidental formations, because we can’t fully comprehend how they are made in their complexity. In that sense these forms withdraw themselves partly from understanding. The human is not just a rational being, but also has irrational needs that need to be catered for. For this realm architecture has to provide spaces and stimuli. In traditional Japanese architecture crooked trees are used for construction to incorporate the poetic. This doesn’t follow pure needs of the construction. Also Eero Saarinen writes in his reflections about the expressive form that structural and rational can’t always be given precedence if other forms prove more beautiful. \n \n For this reason in a next experiment a different approach is tested: A snow pile is shaped intuitively as in a form of abstract painting. Nevertheless in building the intent of the human is always of importance, which is why the uncontrolled should be controlled. Only contemporary technology makes it possible to handle this uncontrolledness. With the help of a 3D-Laserscanner at any time the form can be recorded within minutes in millimetre precision. Therefore this form is then recorded with a pointcloud. With this the shape is transferred into the digital where further alterations are possible. In the digital scale is of minor importance and it is possible to analyse every shape structurally."

In a next step we investigate thinking manually and producing digitally. A digital form can be the outcome or influence reality in a process. It is a starting point to rethink the relationship of the digital and mechanical. Chance and mathematical exactitude don’t exclude each other. Our design process corresponds to stochastic calculatory processes of contemporary computational networks or searching algorithms such as google: Markov-chains make it possible to find probable solutions for the future without knowing all elements precisely. \n \n A next experiment researches this process in full building scale: Snow is piled into a form. This form is recorded with a laser scanner. Translated into a mesh this form can be analysed structurally and afterwards altered in reality. This process is repeated until satisfaction. In an iterative process adapting, scanning, analysing take turns to find a form. The adaption is done by hand in the awareness that a quality of architecture can lie in the handcrafted, manually executed. Once a form is found concreting turns the shape from a negative into a positive. \n \n In this way processes come together that haven’t been combined before. The form is not only natural but also technical. Through this it withdraws itself partially from understanding and introduces a new quality of the mysterious combined with technology."

Technology doesn’t act as controlling instance anymore, but enables freedom and experiment. In times of digitalising the architectural design process for the meticulous planning up to whole building models, this process restores freedom to the architect in the building process. In our process there is also an abstract idea of the outcome. The definitive result, however, is strongly influenced by the process: A maximum gradient is given by how the material can be accumulated. New Forms are created through melting. Sometimes on site it is decided to alter the form. Openings are a result of the necessity to reach all surface area while concreting. It is as playing a game: Sometimes chance and intuition are taking their turn, other times deliberate decisions are made. \n \n We understand architecture as something that is made. The potential of a material condition acts as a starting point to explore technology and the digital in architecture. With the digitalisation of our society the imprecise is gaining importance. Algorithms are not computing a single truth anymore, but follow stochastic evaluation processes and thus find solutions that are true with a certain probability."

In many ways nature is a resource for the creative human, but also a counterpoint in his own work. \n \n This project is doing basic research about architectural design- and building processes. It uses natural materials for experiments to examine a relationship between the accurate and the inaccurate in today’s architecture. The goal is to explore spaces that reconciles constructional accuracy with mystery and intuition of natural processes as well as manual labour. Commonly the two are perceived as opposing players. Construction/Technology as an exact science that knows exactly one truth. In contrast nature is associated with the wild, uncontrolled, where, although following certain formation processes, randomness always plays a role. \n \n Step by step our experiments were oscillating between the worlds of the accurate and inaccurate: A first small-scale experiment was structurally optimised for compression forces in RhinoVault. Through measuring this form was more or less accurately recreated on site. For a next structural experiment inaccuracies were taken into account through incorporating structural redundancies. Further experiments developed a process of accurately measuring all inaccuracies to enable freedom and experiment. \n \n Our investigations are a starting point to think about the potential of materials, the digital in architecture and the relationship of construction and mysterious. We recognise architecture as a rational as well as an irrational endeavour that always needs to be negotiated between these two fields. A fascination for the precise, engineered is brought together with something that is handmade, formed by nature, something that is closer to the human, with imperfections."

Research was conducted on the possibility of building shell structures made of ice. \n \n A super-lightweight glassfibre net is used as stay in place formwork. With ropes this membrane is stretched between rebar arches, creating a complex geometry in-between. Once erected the net is sprayed with water creating a continuous ice surface. In the end the boundary conditions can be taken away and the ice shell stands on its own. \n \n Although in this case the end result is only temporary, it created an awareness that the natural condition of temperature can be integrated in a building process.
