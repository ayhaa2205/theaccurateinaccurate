Therefore every architectural project must start with being sensitive to what is at hand. A place, a material condition. Since in architecture we expend an enormous amount of energy, we have to take the circumstances to our advantage. Thus every project starts by identifying opportunities that are latent in a broad range of circumstances. \n Trying to identify an opportunity for building in the Swiss mountains, one material can hardly be ignored since it is for free and available in abundance: Snow. Because it is available in abundance, but subject to transformation processes, the idea is to use it as formwork material for concrete shells. In a first experiment the feasability of the concept is tested. In a backpack only cement is carried to the remote location. All other materials are sourced locally: Water from a lake, gravel from the surrounding site, snow from a leftover patch from last winter. Since concrete works best in compression, a precise form for compression-only is planned using RhinoVault beforehand."

It’s character isn’t complete controllability. It rather stands out due to its easy manageability and the emergence of random formations. We want to take advantage of these chances in our project. With every material it is about identifying the opportunities that are given by its inherent properties. By using snow as formwork material for concrete shells we give the uncontrolled influence in our experiments. \n A second experiment is conducted to explore potentials of snow shaping. The thermal properties of snow are harnessed to use hot water as a shaping tool. As a natural process not all factors can always be controlled, which leaves room for accident and emergence. Because of the partly melting surface not all of the gypsum reacts with the air creating a rough and archaic surface."

Through their efficient structural behaviour concrete shell structures are able to cover large spaces at minimal material consumption. They are thin, curved plate structures shaped to transmit applied forces by compressive, tensile, and shear stresses, that act in the plane of the surface1. \n In the design of shell constructions nature was first introduced by Heinz Isler. With the aid of models he observed natural phenomena that he used for finding forms that follow the natural flow of forces. With this very thin shells could be realised. Natural processes were used as a design tool for the design process. To this category also the soap film experiments of Otto Frei can be attributed. One of the main principles is the inversion of tension only forms to forms under compression. \n Despite their structural efficiency the construction of shells traditionally requires both material- and labor-intensive formworks. Often materials are only used once, since they are customised for a specific geometry. Moreover in a contemporary building environment labor is expensive and therefore makes concrete shell structures rather costly. \n 1 from Encyclopaedia Britannica"

This solves the problems of waste material and manual labor at the stage of demolding. \n Snow is a porous material of air and water that forms mostly in the winter at temperatures around 0 °C. \n Architecturally, with its very specific properties, snow offers new possibilities for shaping and texturing, potentially using natural flows of water for shaping and form finding. \n The project brings together high technological planning with hands-on construction using natural, locally available materials.

Surface temperatures of the concrete will be around 0°C where it comes in contact with the snow. \n Therefore we collaborate with the the Institute of Physical Chemistry of Building Materials to find an adequate mixture and to test material behaviour in cold environments. \n Two different mixtures are compared: One stabilized, self-compacting mixture and another one with potash added for improved behaviour in cold environments. Four samples are stored in a cooling chamber at -1°C, two samples are cured in a climate chamber at ideal conditions and two other samples are directly cast on ice surfaces. The ingredients are cooled down to a temperature of 4°C before mixing. \n The idea is to use locally-sourced sand, gravel and water for the concrete mixture. For only using local materials in the future Earthen Concrete invented by Oxara might be used. Earthen Concrete is excavation material enriched with an additive to use it as building material. \n After seven days the compressive strength of the different samples is compared: The cold-environment-samples of the stabilized-self-compacting concrete withstand approximately 10% less compressive strength than the ones being cured under ideal conditions, whereas potash-samples exhibit signifacantly inferior behaviour. Therefore we decide on a mixture without potash that is easier to use as well."

First shells were planned with the help of basic mathematically defined forms: Cupolas, barrel vaults; These shapes can easily be described mathematically and therefore their complexity becomes manageable to a certain point. Shell pioneers like Felix Candela introduced more complex forms like hyperbolic paraboloids, that however still are mathematically defined forms. In this evolution Eduardo Torroja used mathematical formulas to generate even more complex forms following a simple principle. These mathematically defined shapes often appear very elegant, because they follow an order and our mind can follow their creation to a certain degree. To test the viability of the previous experiments a structural prototype is erected. The shape is created with a simple mathematical operation: A sinus curve is extruded along a parabola to create an arch. Under self-weight a catenary is the most efficient for for spanning a distance. However, since the goal is to stand on the structure in the end, also asymmetrical loading cases have to be taken into account. The corrugation of the sinus curve adds structural depth to make the arch more stable for asymmetrical loading cases. This makes the arch more robust for inaccuracies of the formwork material as well. In this manner the slight difference between parabola and catenary can be neglected. An arch spanning 1.8m with a height of 1m is constructed. The developed concrete mixture is used without any reinforcement. The finished arch is able to withstand the point load of two people of approximately 150 kg."

In an analogy the human is not just a rational being, but has also irrational needs that need to be catered for. For this realm architecture has to provide spaces and stimuli as well. In traditional Japanese architecture crooked trees are used for construction to incorporate the poetic. Eero Saarinen writes in his reflections about the expressive form that structural and rational can’t always be given precedence if other forms prove more beautiful. \n For this reason in a next experiment a different approach is tested: A snow pile is shaped intuitively as in a form of abstract painting. Nevertheless in building the intent of the human is always of importance, which is why the uncontrolled should be controlled. Only contemporary technology makes it possible to handle this uncontrolledness. With the help of a 3D-Laserscanner at any time the form can be recorded within minutes in millimetre precision. Therefore this form is then recorded with a pointcloud. With this the shape is transferred into the digital where further alterations are possible. As an example scale is of minor importance in the digital, as well as it is possible to analyse shapes structurally."

Our relationship can be indeed expended by thinking manually and then producing digitally. This can result in a final result or can be translated back again from virtuality to physical reality. In our physical reality scale plays an enormous role, in the digital usually scale doesn’t matter. Therefore our project is also a starting point to rethink our relationship with the digital and mechanical. Chance and mathematical exactitude don’t exclude each other. In an analogous way our design process corresponds to stochastic calculatory processes of contemporary computational networks or searching algorithms such as google. Markov-chains make it possible to find probable solutions for the future without knowing all elements precisely. \n In a next step a snow form can be built in 1 to 1 scale. After recording with a laser scanner this form can be analysed structurally and adapted until satisfaction. In an iterative process adapting, scanning, analysing take turns to find a form. The adaption is done by hand in the awareness that a quality of architecture can lie in the handcrafted, manually executed. Once a form is found concreting can happen to turn the shape from a negative into a positive. \n In this way processes come together that haven’t been combined before. The form is not only natural but also technical. Through this it withdraws itself partially from understanding and introduces a new quality of the mysterious combined with technology."

In times of digitalising the architectural design process for the meticulous planning up to whole building models, this process restores freedom to the architect in the building process. On that point Seijima argues how important it is for her to handle the presence of undefined variables in the design process4. In our process there is also a rough idea of what should be created. The definitive outcome though is strongly influenced by the process: A maximum gradient is given by how the material can be accumulated. New Forms are created through melting. Sometimes the architect decides on site to alter the form. Openings are a result to reach all surface area while concreting. It is more like playing a game. Sometimes chance and intuition are taking their turn, other times deliberate decisions are made. Step by step our experiments were oscillating between these two worlds. A first small-scale experiment was structurally optimised for compression forces in RhinoVault. Through measuring this form was more or less accurately recreated on site. For a next structural experiment inaccuracies were taken into account through incorporating structural redundancies. Folding increases the structural section and make a structure more robust for inaccuracies. For redundancies folds were also used for a further experiment where they were created from spontaneous opportunities. Structurally these deformations were controlled to keep folding only in favourable directions. We understand our investigations as a starting point to think about the potential of materials, the digital in architecture and the relationship of construction and mysterious. Architecture is a rational as well as an irrational endeavour and will always only be negotiated between these two fields. 4 in ElCroquis 77(I), kazuo sejima; koji taki (1996), conversation with kazuo sejima, p. 6-17;"

In many ways nature is a resource for the creative human, but also a counterpoint in his own work. \n Increasing computational methods introduced computational models to the design of shells, that simulate a potential optimal force flow and thus create a shape. These forms correspond with the optimal force flow and therefore generate efficient constructions under self load. Though in nature there can always be surprising load cases, which is why there isn’t one perfect form, but of course more and less appropriate. Irregular forms often prove to be more robust. Uncontrolled processes can be of advantage."

Research was conducted on the possibility of building shell structures made of ice. A super-lightweight glassfibre net is used as stay in place formwork. With ropes this membrane is stretched between rebar arches, creating a complex geometry in-between. Once erected the net is sprayed with water creating a continuous ice surface. In the end the boundary conditions can be taken away and the ice shell is finished. Although in this case the end result is only temporary, it created an awareness that the natural condition of temperature can be integrated in a building process. So we asked ourselves: Can we use the temporary nature to our advantage?"
